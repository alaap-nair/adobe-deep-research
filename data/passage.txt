Title: Cellular Respiration Overview (Glycolysis → TCA Cycle → ETC)
Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert the chemical energy stored in glucose into ATP, a usable energy currency. In aerobic respiration, oxygen is the final electron acceptor, allowing cells to extract more energy from glucose than in anaerobic conditions.
Glycolysis is the first major stage of cellular respiration. It occurs in the cytosol and does not require oxygen. During glycolysis, one molecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. Glycolysis produces a net gain of ATP and reduces NAD⁺ to NADH, which carries high-energy electrons.
If oxygen is available, pyruvate is transported into the mitochondrion. There, pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA, releasing carbon dioxide and producing additional NADH. Acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle (also called the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), a series of reactions in the mitochondrial matrix that generates carbon dioxide, NADH, and FADH₂. The citric acid cycle produces a small amount of ATP directly, but its primary role is to generate electron carriers.
The electron transport chain (ETC) is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. NADH and FADH₂ donate electrons to the ETC. As electrons move through protein complexes in the chain, their energy is used to pump protons (H⁺) from the matrix into the intermembrane space, creating a proton gradient. This gradient stores potential energy.
ATP synthase uses the proton gradient to produce ATP in a process called chemiosmosis. As protons flow back into the matrix through ATP synthase, the enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. Oxygen accepts electrons at the end of the electron transport chain and combines with protons to form water. If oxygen is not available, the electron transport chain cannot function, the proton gradient collapses, and ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation decreases.
